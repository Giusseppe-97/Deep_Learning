 Linear Forward
Now that you have initialized your parameters, you can do the forward propagation module. 
Start by implementing some basic functions that you can use again later when implementing the model. 
Now, you'll complete three functions in this order:

LINEAR
LINEAR -> ACTIVATION where ACTIVATION will be either ReLU or Sigmoid.
[LINEAR -> RELU]  ×  (L-1) -> LINEAR -> SIGMOID (whole model)
The linear forward module (vectorized over all the examples) computes the following equations:

𝑍[𝑙]=𝑊[𝑙]𝐴[𝑙−1]+𝑏[𝑙]
where  𝐴[0]=𝑋 .
